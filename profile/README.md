# 🧠 Geniusrise

Welcome to Geniusrise, an ambitious project aimed at creating "geniuses" - fine-tuned Language Learning Models (LLMs) that are more aligned to the organizations that use them.

## 🎯 What is Geniusrise?

Geniusrise is a project that integrates data from various services and prepares and fine-tunes LLMs. The goal is to create models that are more tailored and effective for specific organizational needs. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, Geniusrise aims to revolutionize how organizations interact with and utilize AI models.

## 🌐 Data Integration

At the heart of Geniusrise is the ability to pull data from a wide array of sources. This includes communication platforms, project management tools, document management systems, code hosting platforms, customer support platforms, and CRM systems. This data is then used to inform and guide the fine-tuning of LLMs.

## 🎛️ Fine-Tuning Process

The fine-tuning process involves using the integrated data to generate prompts, which are then used to fine-tune the target LLM. This results in a model that is more aligned and effective for the specific tasks and needs of an organization.

Join us on this exciting journey to create "geniuses"! 🎉
